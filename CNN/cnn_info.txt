conv(I, K) = I 'star' rot180(K)
where I is input Matrix and K is the Kernel
and star is cross-correlation and * is the convolution

2 types of cross-correlation: valid & full

Y = I - K + 1 # each denote the width or height of matrix

Convolutional Layer is a generalization of the Dense Layer.

Analogy:

Dense = Treat every pixel as unrelated, just throw them all into one big equation.

Convolutional = Scan the image with small “pattern detectors” that look for the same thing everywhere.
